         Disabling repeat represolve because of lazy constraint/incumbent callback.
Tried aggregator 1 time.
Reduced MIP has 48 rows, 1128 columns, and 2256 nonzeros.
Reduced MIP has 1128 binaries, 0 generals, 0 SOSs, and 0 indicators.
Presolve time = 0.27 sec. (0.57 ticks)
Probing time = 0.08 sec. (0.18 ticks)
MIP emphasis: balance optimality and feasibility.
MIP search method: traditional branch-and-cut.
Parallel mode: none, using 1 thread.
